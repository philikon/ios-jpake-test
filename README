This is an experimental client for my iOS J-PAKE implementation. It talks to the unreleased Python jpake-server project.

This is really just for development and testing. Don't expect a fully working setup here.

Build instructions:

 git clone git@github.com:st3fan/ios-jpake.git
 git clone git@github.com:st3fan/ios-jpake-test.git

Then simply build and run PakeClient from ios-jpake-test/Mobile.
